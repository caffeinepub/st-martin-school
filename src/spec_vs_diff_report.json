  "summary": "Most frontend page structure and navigation appears implemented (routes, header with mobile hamburger, footer, themed styling, page content blocks, News & Events filtering with expandable items, and Contact form UI wired to a backend call). Key gaps are in backend persistence/stable storage for contact submissions and lack of evidence that the required generated image assets were added under the specified public path. Some unrequested authentication/Internet Identity infrastructure and attribution footer content were added.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Backend persists contact submissions across canister upgrades using stable storage patterns appropriate for Motoko; provide update method to store with timestamp and a query method to retrieve recent submissions.",
      "reason": "The backend stores submissions in a non-stable `let submissions = List.empty<...>()` with no stable variable or preupgrade/postupgrade handling shown. Also `getRecentSubmissions` is declared `shared` (not query) in the diff summary, and the storage API usage shown does not evidence persistence across upgrades.",

      "requirement": "Add generated image assets (crest/logo and homepage hero illustration) as static files under frontend/public/assets/generated with specified filenames, and use them in header and homepage hero.",
      "reason": "Code references the required filenames/paths, but the diff summary does not include any added files under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and notes that 2 added files were omitted due to limits without identifying them. There is insufficient evidence that the images themselves were added in the required directory.",
